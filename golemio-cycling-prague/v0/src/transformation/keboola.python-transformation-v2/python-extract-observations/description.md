The transformation extracts cyclist observation data from the Golemio API using direction IDs sourced from the `location_directions` table. It reads these IDs from a CSV file, makes API calls to retrieve cyclist detection data for specified weekly intervals, and transforms the data to match the schema of the `cyclists_observations` table. The transformed data is then written to an output CSV file, which is subsequently stored in the `bicycles_observations` table.

The process involves calculating fixed weekly intervals for API calls, reading direction IDs from the input file, making API requests for each direction and interval, transforming the API response records, and writing the observations to the output file. The transformation is designed to handle multiple weeks of data and multiple direction IDs efficiently, ensuring that the cyclist observation data is accurately extracted and stored for further analysis.
